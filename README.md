## üìë Including "model-identity-go" as go module into another project's source code.
Since the "model-identity-go" module is in the "**ic-matcom**" private github repository, several previous steps
must be carried out.

#### 1. Set GOPRIVATE in a environment like below: 

```bash
go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.com/ic-matcom
```
‚ùó Multiple values are separated by a comma.

#### 2. Passing repository credentials to Go module
```bash
git config --global url."https://username:accessToken_or_Password@github.com".insteadOf "https://github.com"
```
‚ùó If your user has any @ change to %40. This type of special strings must be url encoded.

#### 3. Finally, we import the module
```bash
go get github.com/ic-matcom/model-identity-go
```
